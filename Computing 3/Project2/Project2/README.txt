For part 5 what my program does is it determines how close the dealers hand is to a better one and chooses cards based on how close it is to a better hand.  If the hand is two away from a flush it will get rid of the two cards taht aren't of the right suit and draw two new ones.  I couldn't get my algorithm for detecting how close the hand is to being a straight, I didn't have the time to figure it out.

Twenty-Games 1:
Dealer wins: 7
Player wins: 13
Note: Player got very lucky with initial deals.

Twenty Games 2: 
Dealer wins: 12
Player wins: 8
Note: Dealer got lucky.

I think I could refine the algorithm a little more and try to make the dealer win.  The problem is that anyone who plays poker would make the same decisions as my algorithm.  I wasn't able to test with someone who didn't really know how to play.
