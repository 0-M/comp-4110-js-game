1a.  The most efficient way is to keep halving.  For example you start by guessing 500, if it says the number is higher you guess 750 (halfway between 500 and 1000) and you continue to do this until you arrive at the number.  If it says higher you guess halfway up if it says lower you guess halfway down.  Also round up if the number has a decimal.

1b.  The maximum number of guesses you would need to take is 12.
