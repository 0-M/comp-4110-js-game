Dear Sir or Madam:

I was pleased to meet your representative at the job fair at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.  I'm seeking a three-month or six-month internship starting the summer of 2017 and am interested in the position of Cyber Security Intern or Software Engineering Intern.  A position at MITRE appeals to me because of my strong interest in cyber security and software engineering.  I've been working with C++ for over two years and have experience with the Boost libraries.  
 
I'm excited about working on software that will be delivered to customers, and believe that my skills and interests would be well utilized at your company.  I look forward to talking with you further about internship opportunities at MITRE.  Thank you for your consideration.
 
Sincerely,
Zachary Krausman
