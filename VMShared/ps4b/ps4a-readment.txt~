 I think the hardest part of the assignment was figuring out how to find whether or not the device booted.  So what I decided to do was to create a boolean and if you found a starting line the next time you went through at the beginning it would check for another starting line and for an ending line.  Depending on which it found first it would output something different, both would reset the boolean.
